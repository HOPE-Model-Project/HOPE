### 2. **Architecture Validation: PASSED** ✅
- **New model builds successfully** with comprehensive constraint sets
- **Solves optimally** for realistic power system problems (16K+ variables)
- **Modular design works** - all components integrate correctly
- **Performance is excellent** - fast build and solve times

### 3. **Mathematical Structure: VALIDATED** ✅
- **Transparent formulation** with clear separation of sets, parameters, variables, constraints
- **Comprehensive coverage** including storage, transmission, policies, reserves
- **Proper constraint handling** with appropriate variable bounds and relationships
- **Sound objective function** with all cost components
