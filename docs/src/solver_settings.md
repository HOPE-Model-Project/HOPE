# Solver Settings Explanation

The **HOPE** model can use multiple solvers to solve optimization problems. The solver parameters are saved in the following `yml` files: `cbc_settings.yml`, `clp_settings.yml`, `cplex_settings.yml`, `gurobi_settings.yml`, `highs_settings.yml`, `scip_settings.yml`, etc. In general, users do not need to modify these files.  Each solver may have its own different settings parameters, if one wants to modify these parameters, it would be better to check the corresponding solver's documentation.
