# Run a Case in HOPE

## Using VS Code to Run a Case (Recommended)

Install Visual Studio Code: download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [install](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) it. A short video tutorial on how to install VS Code and add Julia to it can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi5dZxPGNlk).

**(1)** Open VS Code, click `File -> Open Folder...`, and navigate to your local `HOPE` repository directory.

**(2)** In the VS Code terminal, type `julia` and press Enter. Julia will open as below:

**(3)** Type `]` to enter Julia package mode, then run `activate .` from the repository root. You should see the prompt change from `(@v1.x) pkg>` to `(HOPE) pkg>`, which means the HOPE project is activated successfully.

**(4)** Type `instantiate` at the `(HOPE) pkg>` prompt.

**(5)** Type `st` to check that the dependencies have been installed. Type `up` if you want to update package versions. (This step may take some time when you install HOPE for the first time. After HOPE is installed successfully, you can usually skip it.)

**(6)** If there is no error in the above processes, the **HOPE** model has been installed successfully. Then press `Backspace` to return to the Julia prompt. To run an example case (for example, the default Maryland PCM case), type `using HOPE`, then run:

```julia
HOPE.run_hope("ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/")
```

You will see **HOPE** start running:

![image](https://github.com/swang22/HOPE/assets/125523842/33fa4fbc-6109-45ce-ac41-f41a29885525)

The results will be saved in `HOPE/ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/output`.

Note:

- `HOPE.run_hope(...)` accepts normalized case paths. For example, these are all valid:
  - `HOPE.run_hope("ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/")`
  - `HOPE.run_hope("MD_PCM_Excel_case/")`
  - `HOPE.run_hope("HOPE/ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/")`
- Some older screenshots in this page still show the historical `HOPE/ModelCases/...` style. The newer shorter form is recommended.

**(7)** For future runs, you can usually skip steps 4 and 5 and just follow steps 1, 2, 3, and 6.

## Using System Terminal to Run a Case

You can use a system terminal either on Windows or macOS to run a test case. See details below.

### Windows users

**(1)** Open **Command Prompt** from Windows **Start** and navigate to your local `HOPE` repository directory.

**(2)** Type `julia`. Julia will be opened as below:

![image](https://github.com/swang22/HOPE/assets/125523842/6c61bed1-bf8e-4186-bea2-22413fd1328e)

**(3)** Type `]` to enter Julia package mode, then run `activate .`. You should see the prompt change from `(@v1.x) pkg>` to `(HOPE) pkg>`, which means the HOPE project is activated successfully.

**(4)** Type `instantiate` in the `(HOPE) pkg>` prompt. (After HOPE is installed successfully, you can skip this step.)

**(5)** Type `st` to check that the dependencies have been installed. Type `up` if you want to update package versions. (This step may take some time when you install HOPE for the first time. After HOPE is installed successfully, you can usually skip it.)

**(6)** If there is no error in the above processes, the **HOPE** model has been installed successfully. Then click `Backspace` to return to the Julia prompt. To run an example case (for example, the default Maryland PCM case), type `using HOPE`, then run:

```julia
HOPE.run_hope("ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/")
```

You will see **HOPE** start running:

The results will be saved in `HOPE/ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/output`.

![image](https://github.com/swang22/HOPE/assets/125523842/7a760912-b8f2-4d5c-aea0-b85b6eb00bf4)

Note:

- `HOPE.run_hope(...)` accepts normalized case paths. For example, these are all valid:
  - `HOPE.run_hope("ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/")`
  - `HOPE.run_hope("MD_PCM_Excel_case/")`
  - `HOPE.run_hope("HOPE/ModelCases/MD_PCM_Excel_case/")`
- Some older screenshots in this page still show the historical `HOPE/ModelCases/...` style. The newer shorter form is recommended.

**(7)** For future runs, you can usually skip steps 4 and 5 and just follow steps 1, 2, 3, and 6.

## Reuse a Saved Baseline for EREC

For `GTEP` studies, you can ask HOPE to save a machine-readable baseline snapshot together with the normal run outputs. Add this line in `Settings/HOPE_model_settings.yml`:

```yaml
save_postprocess_snapshot: 1       #Int, 0 do not save; 1 save minimal snapshot for later postprocessing such as EREC; 2 save full snapshot with additional solved-run details
```

Then run the case normally:

```julia
using HOPE
res = HOPE.run_hope("ModelCases/my_case/")
```

HOPE will save the snapshot under:

```text
ModelCases/my_case/output/postprocess_snapshot/
```

Later, you can calculate `EREC` from the saved output without re-solving the baseline expansion model:

```julia
using HOPE
erec = HOPE.calculate_erec_from_output("ModelCases/my_case/output")
```

If you already have the solved results in memory from the current Julia session, you can also reuse them directly:

```julia
using HOPE
res = HOPE.run_hope("ModelCases/my_case/")
erec = HOPE.calculate_erec(res)
```

See [EREC Postprocessing](EREC.md) for the recommended `HOPE_erec_settings.yml` workflow.

## Holistic GTEP -> PCM Runs

HOPE supports a two-stage `GTEP -> PCM` workflow through two related entry points:

- `HOPE.run_hope_holistic(gtep_case, pcm_case)` runs the paired cases directly in place.
- `HOPE.run_hope_holistic_fresh(gtep_case, pcm_case)` first creates fresh case clones, skips old `output/` trees, and then runs the same two-stage workflow on those clones.

For most repeatable workflows, `HOPE.run_hope_holistic_fresh(...)` is the preferred option because it avoids stale outputs from earlier runs and preserves the original source cases as reusable baselines.

Example:

```julia
using HOPE

result = HOPE.run_hope_holistic_fresh(
  "ModelCases/MD_GTEP_holistic_full8760_case_v20260406g",
  "ModelCases/MD_PCM_holistic_full8760_case_v20260406g",
)
```

Key requirements:

- The `GTEP` and `PCM` cases must use the same topology. In practice that means the same `zonedata.Zone_id` set, the same transmission corridors in `linedata`, and internally consistent zone labels across `zonedata`, `gendata`, `storagedata`, and the zonal time-series inputs.
- `GTEP` is the expansion stage and `PCM` is the dispatch stage. HOPE first solves `GTEP`, then updates the paired `PCM` system with the `GTEP` decisions on new builds, retirements, storage additions, and transmission expansion before running chronological dispatch.

If the pair is not topology-matched, HOPE stops before the `GTEP` solve and reports the mismatch directly. This is preferable to an implicit zone remap because the holistic workflow is intended to dispatch the same system that the expansion model planned.

If you want to validate a pair before solving, you can also use the generic audit helper:

```powershell
julia --project=. tools/repo_utils/audit_holistic_case_pair.jl <GTEP_case> <PCM_case>
```
