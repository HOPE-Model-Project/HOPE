# Model Overview
 The HOPE consists of multiple modes for modeling optimization problems of modern power systems and electricity markets, including:
1. `GTEP` mode: a generation & transmission expansion planning model
2. `PCM` mode: a production cost model
3. `OPF` mode: (under development): an optimal power flow model
4. `DART` mode: (under development): a bilevel market model for simulating day-head and real-time markets
