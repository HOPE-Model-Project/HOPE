# HOPE-AI: Running HOPE with an LLM Agent

HOPE supports agentic AI control via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) — a standard that lets LLM hosts invoke tools, run models, and read results without any manual scripting. This page explains two supported setups:

- **Claude Desktop** with a local full-access `stdio` MCP server for running cases, changing settings, and opening dashboards.
- **ChatGPT web** with a remote read-only MCP server for inspecting cases and outputs through developer mode.

!!! note "PowerAgent community"
    The HOPE MCP server is part of [PowerAgent](https://poweragent.seas.harvard.edu/) — an open-source community for agentic AI in power systems, maintained by the [Power and AI Initiative (PAI)](https://pai.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard SEAS. The HOPE server is also distributed through [PowerMCP](https://github.com/Power-Agent/PowerMCP/tree/main/HOPE), a collection of MCP servers for power system software.

## Available Tools

Once configured, Claude Desktop will have access to **16 HOPE tools** organized into six groups:

### Job Execution

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hope_warmup` | Pre-compiles the Julia/HOPE environment in the background. Call once per session before the first run. Returns a `job_id` immediately. |
| `hope_run_hope` | Launches a HOPE single-case optimization run (GTEP or PCM) in the background. Returns a `job_id` immediately. |
| `hope_run_holistic` | Launches a two-stage GTEP→PCM holistic workflow: Stage 1 solves capacity expansion; Stage 2 fixes the built fleet and runs production-cost dispatch. Returns a `job_id` immediately. |
| `hope_run_erec` | Launches EREC (Equivalent Reliability Enhancement Capability) postprocessing on a completed run to quantify each resource's reliability contribution. Returns a `job_id` immediately. |
| `hope_job_status` | Polls any background job for progress. Returns elapsed time, stdout tail, and the full output summary when the job completes. |

### Settings Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hope_update_settings` | Patches any field in `HOPE_model_settings.yml` — e.g., change `carbon_policy`, `solver`, `network_model`, or `unit_commitment`. Validates each value, backs up the original file, and warns on contradictions. |
| `hope_validate_case` | Checks settings for contradictions and missing files (e.g., `write_shadow_prices=1` without `network_model > 0`, or a missing solver settings file). Returns a warning list and `is_valid` flag. |

### Output Reading

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hope_case_info` | Reads case settings and output file inventory instantly — no Julia required. |
| `hope_output_summary` | Reads and summarizes existing output CSVs (system cost, capacity builds, storage builds) instantly — no Julia required. |
| `hope_read_output` | Reads any specific output CSV with optional column filters — e.g., dispatch for a single zone, or capacity for one technology. |
| `hope_emission_compliance` | Parses `carbon_emissions.csv` and `rps_target.csv` to report per-state compliance status, violation amounts, and penalty costs. |
| `hope_nodal_prices` | Reads locational marginal prices (LMPs) from `nodal_prices.csv`, optionally filtered by bus/zone and hour range. |

### Scenario Comparison

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hope_compare_cases` | Compares system cost, capacity builds (MW by technology), storage builds (MWh), and CO2 emissions across two or more cases. Returns side-by-side tables and diffs relative to a baseline. |

### Audit Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hope_rep_day_audit` | Summarizes representative-period clustering: period assignments, weights, total representative hours, and compression ratio vs. a full 8760-hour year. |
| `hope_aggregation_audit` | Summarizes resource aggregation: raw-to-cluster mapping, reduction ratio (e.g., 120 generators to 30 clusters), and per-cluster capacity. |

### Dashboard

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hope_open_dashboard` | Launches the local HOPE Dash dashboard for a completed case run and returns its URL. Automatically picks the GTEP dashboard (port 8051) or the PCM dashboard (port 8050) based on `model_mode`. If a dashboard is already running on the target port, returns the existing URL immediately. |
| `hope_close_dashboard` | Stops a dashboard launched by `hope_open_dashboard`. Pass `port=8051` or `port=8050` to stop a specific dashboard, or omit `port` to stop all dashboards tracked in the current session. |

## Prerequisites

- **HOPE** cloned and Julia environment instantiated (see [Installation](@ref))
- **Python** >= 3.10 (the MCP server is a Python package)
- **uv** ([astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv)) — fast Python package manager
- **Claude Desktop** ([claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)) or any MCP-compatible LLM host

---

## One-Time Setup

### Step 1 — Install uv

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Restart your terminal after installation so `uv` is on your PATH.

### Step 2 — Sync the MCP server Python package

```bash
uv --directory /path/to/HOPE/tools/hope_mcp_server sync
```

This creates a local `.venv` inside `tools/hope_mcp_server/` with all dependencies (including the `mcp` package).

### Step 3 — Configure Claude Desktop

Locate your Claude Desktop config file:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  (typically `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`)
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the `hope` server entry:

**Windows example:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hope": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\path\\to\\HOPE\\tools\\hope_mcp_server",
        "run",
        "hope-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HOPE_REPO_ROOT": "C:\\path\\to\\HOPE",
        "HOPE_JULIA_BIN": "C:\\Users\\<user>\\.julia\\juliaup\\julia-1.x.y+0.x64.w64.mingw32\\bin\\julia.exe"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**macOS / Linux example:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hope": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/HOPE/tools/hope_mcp_server",
        "run",
        "hope-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HOPE_REPO_ROOT": "/path/to/HOPE",
        "HOPE_JULIA_BIN": "/path/to/.julia/juliaup/julia-1.x.y+0.aarch64.apple.darwin14/bin/julia"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

!!! tip "Finding your Julia binary path"
    Run `julia -e 'println(Sys.BINDIR)'` in a terminal to print the exact path to your Julia binary directory. The binary is `julia` (macOS/Linux) or `julia.exe` (Windows) inside that directory. If `julia` is already on your system PATH, you can omit the `HOPE_JULIA_BIN` key entirely.

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config.

### Step 4 — Optional ChatGPT web read-only setup

ChatGPT currently requires a **remote HTTPS MCP endpoint**. The simplest workflow is:

1. start the read-only HOPE server locally,
2. expose it through a tunnel such as **Cloudflare Tunnel**,
3. connect the resulting HTTPS `/mcp` URL in ChatGPT web developer mode.

The read-only ChatGPT entrypoint exposes only analysis tools such as `hope_case_info`, `hope_output_summary`, `hope_read_output`, and comparison/audit helpers. It does **not** expose `hope_run_hope`, `hope_update_settings`, or dashboard-launch tools.

!!! note "Current plan limitations"
    As of April 14, 2026, OpenAI's public help docs indicate that full MCP support is rolling out for **Business / Enterprise / Edu** plans, while **Pro** can connect remote MCPs with read/fetch permissions in developer mode. In our testing, a **Plus** account did not expose the custom MCP app flow needed for this setup. Check the current OpenAI docs and your account UI before relying on ChatGPT-side access.

**Step 4a — Start the read-only server locally**

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:HOPE_REPO_ROOT = "C:\path\to\HOPE"
$env:HOPE_MCP_PORT = "8001"
$env:HOPE_MCP_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
$env:HOPE_MCP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME = "hope.example.com"
& "C:\path\to\HOPE\tools\hope_mcp_server\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m hope_mcp_server.chatgpt
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
HOPE_REPO_ROOT=/path/to/HOPE \
HOPE_MCP_PORT=8001 \
HOPE_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
HOPE_MCP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=hope.example.com \
/path/to/HOPE/tools/hope_mcp_server/.venv/bin/python -m hope_mcp_server.chatgpt
```

**Step 4b — Publish the local port through Cloudflare Tunnel**

1. Install `cloudflared`.
2. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel and install the connector on the machine running HOPE.
3. Add a **published application route** (public hostname), for example:
   - hostname: `hope.example.com`
   - service: `http://localhost:8001`
4. Keep the local HOPE server process running while the tunnel is active.

**Step 4c — Connect the MCP endpoint in ChatGPT web**

Use the tunnel URL with the MCP path:

```text
https://hope.example.com/mcp
```

If you test that URL with a plain browser or `curl`, you may see a `406 Not Acceptable` response asking for `text/event-stream`. That is expected: it means the route is reachable, but the client is not speaking MCP yet.

## Typical Claude Desktop Session

Julia's first startup includes precompilation which can take several minutes. The recommended flow is:

**1. Warm up Julia (once per session)**

> *"Warm up Julia for HOPE."*

Claude calls `hope_warmup`, which launches Julia precompilation in the background and returns a `job_id`. Claude then polls `hope_job_status` until precompilation finishes (~3-5 min on first call, much faster on subsequent calls in the same session).

**2. Validate and optionally update settings**

> *"Check the md_gtep_clean case settings and enable the carbon cap."*

Claude calls `hope_validate_case` to detect any contradictions, then `hope_update_settings` to patch `carbon_policy: 1` into `HOPE_model_settings.yml`. The original file is backed up automatically.

**3. Run a HOPE case**

> *"Run the md_gtep_clean HOPE case."*

Claude calls `hope_run_hope` (or `hope_run_holistic` for a two-stage GTEP-PCM run), which launches HOPE as a background process and returns a `job_id` immediately. Claude polls `hope_job_status` until the run completes. When done, the output summary is returned automatically.

**4. Inspect results**

> *"Summarize the capacity investments. Are we in compliance with the carbon cap?"*

Claude calls `hope_output_summary` for the cost and build summary, then `hope_emission_compliance` to check carbon and RPS policy compliance — all instant, reading only the output CSVs.

**5. Drill into specifics**

> *"Show me the hourly dispatch for solar in zone MD."*

Claude calls `hope_read_output` with `filename="dispatch.csv"` and `filters={"Zone": "MD", "Technology": "SolarPV"}`.

**6. Compare scenarios**

> *"How does cost and emissions change if I also enable the RPS target? Run that version and compare."*

Claude calls `hope_update_settings` to enable `clean_energy_policy: 1`, re-runs with `hope_run_hope`, then calls `hope_compare_cases` to get a side-by-side diff of cost, capacity, and CO2.

---

## Supported Cases

The MCP server now discovers cases dynamically from `ModelCases/` by looking for case directories that contain:

```text
Settings/HOPE_model_settings.yml
```

Accepted case identifiers include:

- exact `ModelCases` directory names such as `USA_64zone_GTEP_case`
- prefixed paths such as `ModelCases/USA_64zone_GTEP_case`
- the legacy alias `md_gtep_clean`

No manual case registry update is needed when you add a new valid case folder under `ModelCases/`.

> "Stop all running dashboards."

---

## Troubleshooting

**MCP server does not appear in Claude Desktop**
Verify the config JSON is valid (no trailing commas, no syntax errors). Restart Claude Desktop fully (quit and reopen).

**`uv` command not found**
Restart your terminal after installing `uv`, or manually add `~/.local/bin` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` (Windows) to your PATH.

**Julia warmup job keeps running for a long time**
This is expected on the very first call — Julia downloads and compiles ~130 packages. Subsequent warmups in the same session are instant since the cache is warm.

**`hope_warmup` fails with AppLocker / Application Control blocking a DLL**
Set `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` in Claude Desktop's config to a directory that your Windows policy explicitly trusts, then restart Claude Desktop and run `hope_warmup` again. On managed Windows machines, moving the depot outside `C:\Users` can help, but it is not sufficient by itself: a path like `E:\julia_depot` may still be blocked unless your IT policy allows that location or whitelists the blocked Julia artifact DLL (for example `libmetis_*.dll`).

**`hope_run_hope` fails with `hope_environment_not_instantiated`**
Call `hope_warmup` first and wait for it to complete before calling `hope_run_hope`.

**`hope_run_erec` fails with `snapshot_not_found`**
Set `save_postprocess_snapshot: 1` in `HOPE_model_settings.yml` (use `hope_update_settings`) and re-run the case before calling `hope_run_erec`.

**`hope_nodal_prices` returns `price_file_not_found`**
LMP output requires `network_model > 0` and `write_shadow_prices: 1` in settings. Use `hope_update_settings` to enable both, then re-run.

**Job ID not found**
Job IDs are in-memory and only valid for the current MCP server session. If Claude Desktop was restarted, old job IDs are gone — start a new warmup/run.
